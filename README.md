Website that allows you to choose the right components for assembling a computer.
Checks the parts available for sale in Portuguese stores (that's where I'm from, based on that), checks the compatibility between the parts chosen by the user, including power supplies, RAM, CPU, motherboard, etc.
The entire project was carried out using:
HTML and CSS for the website.
Python for the web-scraper and database.
SQL Lite for the database.
